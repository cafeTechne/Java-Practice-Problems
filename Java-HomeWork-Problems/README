This folder contains my work from CTP150: Computer Science 1. This was essentially just a Java class because the Professor's grasp of english was tenuous at best. She was very strict on grading the assignments, although she had never worked as a programmer or contributed to an open source project in her life. She did disclose to us that she had hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt from sending her children to expensive private schools though.
